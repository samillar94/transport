Bus maps and information, starting with a redesign of the Belfast bus map.

In the past Translink regularly updated the map with route changes, but after the map was redesigned by Whitenoise Studios in September 2018 maintenance has stopped, despite a significant round of route renumbering in 2019. 

I've taken it upon myself to update and develop the map, endeavouring to make it as accurate and aesthetic as I possibly can. The current version reflects route reductions due to the coronavirus crisis; the last normal version and the development version is January 2020 which saw the introduction of the 11g and 3j services. You can also check out Whitenoise's original 2018 map, the update I did for September 2019, and a fantasy map with more Gliders.

If you're using it, or just exploring it - I hope you enjoy.
